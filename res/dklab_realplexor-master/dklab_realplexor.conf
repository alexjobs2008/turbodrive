## Default configuration file. Do not modify it!
##
## This file is always loaded on startup, but you may redefine
## parameters in other file if you specify path to this file 
## in command-line arguments of dklab_realplexor.pl.
##
## E.g. if you run:
##   # ./dklab_realplexor.pl /etc/my_config.conf
## the following config files will be parsed:
##   1. ./dklab_realplexor.conf
##   3. /etc/my_config.conf
##
## Use this behaviour to override default settings.
